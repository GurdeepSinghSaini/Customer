<!-- 🐍 Python for BI Projects — Customer Behavior Analytics -->

# Customer Behavior Analytics

Small but powerful Python script to analyze customer behavior from Excel/CSV transactions. It computes KPIs, RFM segmentation, and cohort retention, then produces a polished Excel report with a segment chart plus CSV exports for downstream BI tools.

- Input: One or more Excel/CSV files
- Output: An Excel report (XLSX) + CSVs with KPIs, RFM, cohorts, monthly revenue, and top customers
- No database required — pure Python and pandas

## What it does

- Cleans and merges multiple files (supports reading all sheets or a single sheet)
- Computes core commerce KPIs:
  - Customers, orders, revenue, AOV
  - Repeat purchase rate
  - Median reorder interval (days)
- RFM segmentation with robust quantile scoring and a segment profile table
- Cohort retention matrix (Month 0, 1, 2, … since acquisition)
- Exports:
  - Excel: Summary, RFM, Segments, Cohorts, RevenueByMonth, TopCustomers
  - CSVs: kpis, rfm_customers, segment_profiles, cohort_retention, revenue_by_month, top_customers
